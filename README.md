# A/V Accessibility
This is a project that aims to test out a few ideas in the realm of accessibility, particularly how many solutions I'm able to implement to the forms of media below within it's deadline.

To that end, I have decided to try to at least get subtitles, closed captions and transcriptions to be toggleable by the user.
