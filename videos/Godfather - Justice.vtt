00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
I believe in America

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.000
Americans made my fortune

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.000
And I raised my daughter in american fashion

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
She found a boyfriend,
an italian

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She went to the movies with him,
she stayed out late

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.000
I didn't "taught" this

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.000
Two months ago he took her for
a drive with another boy friend

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.000
They made her do whiskey, and then
they tried to take advantage of her

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.800
She resisted, she kept her honor

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
So they beat her, like an animal

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When I went to the hospital, her nose was broken,
her jaw was shattered and held together by wire

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.000
She couldn't even weep, because of the pain...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But I wept

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Why did I weep?

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:22.000
She was the light of my life, 
beautiful girl

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000
Now she will never be beautiful again

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.000
[Bonasera Coughs]

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.000
Sorry

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000
[Bonasera takes a sip]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.700
I...I went to the police,
like a good American

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
These boys were brought to trial,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, then suspended the sentence

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Suspended the sentence...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They went free that very day!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I stood in the courtroom like a fool

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
And those two bastards, they smarted me

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Then I said to my wife,
for justice we must go to Don Corleone

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
What do you want of me?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.500
What is that?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.500
[Bonasera stands up and walks to
where Don Corleone is]

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500
I want them dead

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.500
That I cannot do

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I will give you anything you ask

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.000
We have known each other for many years,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.300
but this is the first time you
ever came for either council or for help

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.400
I can’t remember the last time you invited me
to your house for a cup of coffee

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.500
even though my wife is godmother to your only child

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But let’s be frank here,
you never wanted my friendship

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.000
You were afraid to be in my debt

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.000
I didn’t want to get into trouble

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800
I understand

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.000
You found paradise in america

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.500
Had a good trade, made a good living,
the police protected you and there were courts of law

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.000
You didn't need a friend like me

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.000
But now you come to me and you say:
Don Coerleone, give me justice

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.000
But you don't ask with respect

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.000
You don't offer friendship

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You don't even think to call me Godfather

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Instead you come into my house on
the day my daughter is to be married

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and then you ask me to be a murderer...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.500
for money

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.500
I ask you for justice

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.500
That is not justice, your daughter is still alive

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Make them suffer then

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300
As she suffers

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.000
How much shall I pay you?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.000
[Don Corleone Stands Up]

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.000
Bonasera...Bonasera...what have I ever done
to make you treat me so disrespectfully?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.800
Had you come to me in friendship, the scum that
wound your daughter would be suffering this very day

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.700
And if by chance an honest man
like yourself should make enemies

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
then they would become my enemies,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.000
and then they would fear you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.000
Be my friend...

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.000
Godfather?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Good

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500
Some day...

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.000
and that day may never come,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.600
I'll call upon you to do a service for me

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.200
But then, until that day...

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.200
accept this justice as a gift
of my daughter's wedding day

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.000
Grazie, Godfather

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.000
Give this to Clemenza

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.500
I want reliable people,
people who aren't gonna be carried away

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.500
We are not murderers,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.000
Despite what this undertaker says
