00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.500
So no one told you life was gonna be this way

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Your job's a joke, you're broke

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Your love life's DOA

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's like you're always stuck in second gear

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.500
Or even your year...

7
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)
